# LMX Cloud — Path to Public Beta

Goal: go from working proof-of-concept (Phase 1-7) to something you can hand to strangers — developers trying it for free — without it breaking, leaking data, or embarrassing you. Target: 3-4 weeks. Payments are out of scope for this phase (free beta); pricing/billing becomes Phase 9+ once there's real usage signal.

## Where things actually stand

The core is real: multi-provider routing with fallback, health monitoring, per-key usage tracking, credit balances, and a full dashboard (`apps/web`) are all built and working locally. What's missing isn't features — it's the stuff that only matters once people outside your machine are using it.

Two things found in the audit that should jump the queue:

1. **CORRECTION (2026-07-05): the login gap is NOT resolved — it's live on production right now.** The dashboard frontend did migrate to Clerk (`SignInPage`/`SignUpPage` use Clerk's hosted components, `AuthContext` exchanges a Clerk token via `POST /v1/auth/clerk`) — but the old `POST /v1/auth/login` route in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts` was never removed. It's still registered unconditionally in `server.ts` and still issues a valid session token to anyone who POSTs an email address with an existing account — zero password/OTP/verification. Nothing in the frontend calls it anymore, but the API route doesn't know that: anyone with curl can hit it directly against your deployed Railway URL right now and take over any account by email alone. **This is a live account-takeover vector on a deployed product, not a theoretical one.** Fix: delete the `/v1/auth/login` handler entirely (Clerk fully replaced it, so it's pure attack surface with no remaining legitimate use) rather than trying to patch it.
2. **Deploy:** done.

## Week 1 — Deploy for real, close the security gap

- **Delete `POST /v1/auth/login`.** Clerk already fully replaced it — the frontend never calls it. It's dead code that happens to be a live account-takeover endpoint on the deployed API. Remove the route handler and its registration in `server.ts`; this is a deletion, not a rebuild. (Previously scoped as "build magic-link auth" — unnecessary now that Clerk covers this.)
- **Rotate `SESSION_SECRET`** off the `change-me-in-production` default before deploying anywhere.
- **Deploy API to Railway, dashboard + demo to Vercel**, following DEPLOY.md. Confirm `DATABASE_URL` (Neon) is set so keys/usage persist across restarts — don't launch on file storage.
- **Add error monitoring** (Sentry free tier is enough) and a **basic uptime check** (UptimeRobot / Better Stack) on the API health endpoint. You want to know the router is down before a beta user tells you.
- **Re-check rate limits** for a public audience: `KEY_GEN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`, `CHAT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`, and `INITIAL_CREDIT_BALANCE` currently assume trusted local testing. Decide what stops one person from spinning up 500 keys or draining provider budget in an afternoon.
- **CORS is currently `origin: true`** (allows any site to call the API from a browser). Fine for the demo's cross-origin design, but confirm this is intentional and not just unset — document it either way.

## Week 2 — Make it usable by someone who isn't you

- **Write real API docs** — a docs page or even a well-organized `/docs` markdown, not just the README's PowerShell snippets. Include a curl example (most devs aren't on PowerShell) and a "get a key and get a response in under 60 seconds" quickstart.
- **Add streaming support** to `/v1/chat/completions`. This was flagged as missing in DEPLOY.md and matters a lot for real usage — most chat UIs and SDKs expect streamed tokens, and its absence will be the first thing a technical evaluator notices.
- **Expand model coverage.** Only `llama-3-70b` is aliased today. Add 2-3 more popular models across whichever providers are live (io.net, AkashML) so the router looks like infrastructure, not a single-model demo.
- **Polish the signup → key → first request flow** in `apps/web` and `apps/demo`. Walk through it yourself as a stranger would: confusing error states, unclear balance/cost display, or a broken step here will lose people before they see the product work.
- **Public status page.** You already compute provider health for `/v1/status` — surface it as a simple public page. For a DePIN pitch, visible uptime/fallback transparency is part of the trust story, not just an internal debugging tool.
- **Per-request logs in the console (added 2026-07-05).** `usage_events` already records provider/model/latency/cost/fallback per call, but nothing surfaces individual requests — only aggregated day buckets. Add a `/v1/usage/logs` endpoint and a Logs page in the dashboard so a developer can see each call, which provider it routed to, and its latency, not just daily totals.

## Week 3 — Trust and support basics

- **Terms of Service + Privacy Policy.** Minimal but real — you're collecting emails and usage data from strangers. A generated template (e.g. via a ToS generator or a lawyer-reviewed boilerplate) is enough for a free beta; don't skip it entirely.
- **Acceptable use / abuse policy.** One paragraph: no illegal content, no key sharing/resale, rate limits are enforced, accounts can be revoked. Link it from signup.
- **A feedback channel.** Discord server, a shared email, or a Typeform — something lower-friction than "open a GitHub issue" for non-technical-adjacent testers.
- **Decide (don't build) the future pricing model.** Beta users will ask "what happens when this isn't free." Have a one-line answer ready (e.g. "usage-based, priced near provider cost + margin, beta credits carry over") even though Stripe integration is post-beta.

## Week 4 — Outreach prep

- **Refresh landing copy** around the DePIN value prop specifically: cheaper/more resilient inference via decentralized compute, OpenAI-compatible so it's a drop-in swap. Lead with "get an API key in 30 seconds," link the live demo.
- **Line up first channels**: r/LocalLLaMA, Indie Hackers, AI-dev Discord/Twitter circles, and io.net/Akash community channels (they have an interest in a router that showcases their networks).
- **Run a private dry run first.** Get 2-3 friendly technical testers on the deployed version before the public post — this is where the login flow, rate limits, and error states get caught cheaply instead of publicly.
- **Basic funnel visibility.** You don't need an analytics platform yet — a couple of SQL queries against the Postgres store (signups → first key → first successful request → repeat usage) tells you if outreach is converting.

## Deliberately deferred (not blocking beta)

- Real payments/Stripe billing — free beta means the dev credit top-up is fine for now.
- Wallet/crypto-native auth beyond the existing `wallet` field.
- SDKs beyond raw HTTP — a docs quickstart is enough until there's demand.
- Multi-region/high-availability infra — a single Railway deployment is fine at beta scale.

## Suggested order if the timeline compresses

If 3-4 weeks becomes 1-2: do the login fix, the real deploy with Postgres, and basic monitoring — then go straight to a small private dry run. Docs, streaming, and model coverage matter for *growth* but won't stop a handful of trusted early users from getting real signal.
